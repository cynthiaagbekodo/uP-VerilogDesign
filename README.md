# uP-VerilogDesign
This is a MIPS architecture design done in Verilog. 

This set of instructions will populate the first 16 memory addresses with hex numbers 0 through F increasing by 1 each interation then populate the next 16 addresses with the decreasing sequence from F to 0. The second portion of instruction will add a very large number to each memory location effectively complementing the 4 MSBs at each address.
