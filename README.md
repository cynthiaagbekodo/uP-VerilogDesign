# Microprossesor Architecture Design 

The purpose of this project was to implement the MIPS architedture found in figure

This set of instructions will populate the first 16 memory addresses with hex numbers 0 through F increasing by 1 each interation then populate the next 16 addresses with the decreasing sequence from F to 0. The second portion of instruction will add a very large number to each memory location effectively complementing the 4 MSBs at each address.
