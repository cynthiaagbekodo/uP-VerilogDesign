# Microprossesor Architecture Design 

The purpose of this project was to implement the MIPS architecture found in _architecture_ref_image.png_ such that the microprosessor (uP) could process a set of MIPS instructions given in . 

This set of instructions will populate the first 16 memory addresses with hex numbers 0 through F increasing by 1 each interation then populate the next 16 addresses with the decreasing sequence from F to 0. The second portion of instruction will add a very large number to each memory location effectively complementing the 4 MSBs at each address.
