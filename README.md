# Microprossesor Architecture Design 

The purpose of this project was to implement the MIPS architecture found in _architecture_ref_image.png_ such that the microprosessor (uP) could run a set of instructions provided in _MipsTestCode.s_. 

The first half of instructions will populate the first 16 memory addresses with hex numbers 0 through F increasing by 1 each interation then populate the next 16 addresses with the decreasing sequence from F to 0. The latter half will add a very large number to all 32 memory location effectively complementing the 4 MSBs of each address. A visual of this shown in  .
